### How Data Were Chosen

The datasets in this dictionary were selected based on relevance to the Clean & Green Philly mission, with significant expert input from researchers involved in the project.

We have elected to use only public datasets in our platform. This decision was made to ensure that our data is accessible to all users, regardless of their ability to pay for proprietary data. We also sought to include datasets that are updated regularly, so that our platform can reflect the most current conditions in Philadelphia.

We prioritized datasets that were publicly available, spatially explicit, and updated regularly. We also sought to include datasets that were relevant to the Clean & Green Philly mission, such as those related to vacant land, blight, and community greening.
