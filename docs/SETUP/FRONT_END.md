# Setup Instructions

## Overview

If you are planning to focus on front end development for Clean & Green Philly and do not need to run any of the Python code, follow the installation and setup instructions below.

## Installation

### NVM (Windows Only)

If you are running Windows, you will need to [install NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/blob/master/README.md). Under 'Assets', [nvm-setup.exe](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases) is straightforward. Node.js and nvm ship with Linux and macOS and therefore do not need to be installed for people using those OS.

## Setup

### Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/CodeForPhilly/vacant-lots-proj).
2. Create a fork of the repository by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the page. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.
3. Clone your fork of the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

Note: make sure to keep your fork up to date with the original repository by following the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#keep-your-fork-synced).

### Nextjs App

Navigate to the root directory of the repository. Install dependencies by running `npm i`. Then, run the development server with `npm run dev`. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. Congrats! You're all set up.

### MapTiler

You'll need to set up a free [MapTiler](https://www.maptiler.com/) and get an API key. Once you have this, set it as en environment variable called `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPTILER_KEY`.

### Google Cloud (GCP)

If you are running your own backend and you want to use the tiles file from your own Google cloud bucket, put the bucket name in an environment variable called `GOOGLE_CLOUD_BUCKET_NAME`.  See the backend setup docs for more information on GCP.

#### Formatting

For js/ts, install [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and enable it for your [editor](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html). For VSCode, enable [Format on Save](https://www.robinwieruch.de/how-to-use-prettier-vscode/) for best experience.
