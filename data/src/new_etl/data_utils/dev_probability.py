def dev_probability(primary_featurelayer: FeatureLayer) -> FeatureLayer:
    """
    Calculates development probability based on permit counts and assigns
    development ranks to census block groups. The results are joined to the
    primary feature layer.

    Args:
        primary_featurelayer (FeatureLayer): The feature layer containing property data.

    Returns:
        FeatureLayer: The input feature layer with added spatial join data for
        development probability and ranks.

    Tagline:
        Calculate development probability

    Columns Added:
        permit_count (int): The number of permits issued in the census block group.
        dev_rank (str): The development rank of the census block group.
