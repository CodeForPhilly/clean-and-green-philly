def negligent_devs(primary_featurelayer: FeatureLayer) -> FeatureLayer:
    """
    Identifies negligent developers based on the number of vacant properties owned
    and flags them in the primary feature layer.

    Args:
        primary_featurelayer (FeatureLayer): The feature layer containing property data.

    Columns Added:
        negligent_dev (bool): non-city owned entities owning 5+ vacant properties
        n_total_properties_owned (int): Total number of properties owned by the developer
        n_vacant_properties_owned (int): Number of vacant properties owned by the developer

    Primary Feature Layer Columns Referenced:
        opa_id, vacant, city_owner_agency, standardized_address

    Tagline:
        Identify negligent developers

    Returns:
        FeatureLayer: The input feature layer with additional columns for total properties
        owned, vacant properties owned, and a "negligent_dev" flag.
