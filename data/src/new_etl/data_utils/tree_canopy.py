def tree_canopy(primary_featurelayer: FeatureLayer) -> FeatureLayer:
    """
    Adds tree canopy gap information to the primary feature layer by downloading,
    processing, and spatially joining tree canopy data for Philadelphia County.

    Args:
        primary_featurelayer (FeatureLayer): The feature layer containing property data.

    Returns:
        FeatureLayer: The input feature layer with an added "tree_canopy_gap" column
        indicating the tree canopy gap for each property.

    Tagline:
        Measures tree canopy gaps.

    Columns added:
        tree_canopy_gap (float): The amount of tree canopy lacking.

    Primary Feature Layer Columns Referenced:
