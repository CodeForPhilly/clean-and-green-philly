    Assigns a 'tactical_urbanism' value to each row in the primary feature layer based on specific conditions.

    Tactical urbanism is marked as "Yes" if the property is a parcel of type 'Land',
    and does not have any unsafe or immediately dangerous buildings. Otherwise, it is "No".

    Args:
        primary_featurelayer: A FeatureLayer object containing a GeoDataFrame (`gdf`) as an attribute.

    Columns Added:
        tactical_urbanism (str): Indicates whether each property qualifies for tactical urbanism ("Yes" or "No").

    Primary Feature Layer Columns Referenced:
        parcel_type, unsafe_building, imm_dang_building

    Tagline:
        Identify tactical urbanism-eligible properties

    Returns:
        The input FeatureLayer with a new column 'tactical_urbanism' added to its GeoDataFrame.
