          What does "get access" mean?
        </h2>
        <p className="body-md">
          In order to intervene in a property, you need to have some kind of
          legal access to do so. Broadly, this means either becoming the owner
          of the property yourself or reaching a legal agreement with the owner
          to allow you to transform the property. For every vacant property in
          Philadelphia, Clean & Green Philly highlights what we think the legal
          options are to get access to it. Below, we explain in more detail what
          these options are and how you can get help with each.
        </p>

        <h2 className="heading-2xl font-bold mt-8">
          How can I get access to a specific property?
        </h2>
        <p className="body-md">
          Generally speaking, there are two ways to get access to a property:
          you can either become the owner yourself or reach an agreement with
          the owner to let you access the property. Clean & Green Philly
          highlights three specific ways to become the owner of a property:
          buying it outright, getting it from the Philadelphia Land Bank, or
          being appointed its conservator through Act 135. We also indicate when
          we think the best approach is to reach a private land agreement with
          the property’s owner, which allows you to access the property without
          legally owning it.
          <br />
          <br />
          Although there are other possible ways to get access to a property
          (see below), these four routes are the most common and the only ones
          that we can infer from publicly-available data. Remember also that
          each of these options depends on your specific context. For example,
          Act 135 conservatorship can be a very complicated process and is not
          necessarily suitable for a small community organization that doesn’t
          have legal support. Our goal is to help you understand which of these
          options is best suited for you and, based on that information,
          identify the property or properties where you can have the biggest
          impact.

              Buying a property outright can often be the simplest, fastest way
              to get access to it. However, we recognize that not all properties
              are affordable to grassroots organizations or private individuals.
              Based on our stakeholder research, we mark vacant properties with
              an estimated market value of $1,000 or less as worth buying.

              The Philadelphia Land Bank [https://phdcphila.org/] is part of the
              Philadelphia Housing Development Corporation. It works to
              redistribute publicly-owned land and return vacant properties to
              productive use. Vacant properties owned by the Land Bank can often
              be acquired for nominal or discounted prices for certain kinds of

              The advantage of this process is that it offers grassroots
              organizations and other community-oriented groups to get access to
              land through a non-competitive disposition process at little to no
              cost. However, one is still required to go through the Land Bank’s
              process, which also requires the support of the City Councilmember
              in whose district the property falls. Grounded in Philly provides
              a good overview of how to get permission to use City land

              Act 135 conservatorship can be a potential faster route than other
              legal options but is complicated and requires a lot of resources.
              In short, if a property meets certain specific criteria, it can be
              turned over to a court-appointed conservator for remediation.
              According to the law, it must be unoccupied, abandoned by its
              owner, and unsafe and unhealthy. (For more information, consult
              this explanation of Act 135.
              [https://www.vanderslicelaw.com/service_index/real-estate/act-135/].)
              If those criteria are met, a private individual can petition a
              judge to appoint them as the conservator of the property. The
              conservator is then the owner of the property and can improve it
              as they see fit. However, as mentioned, taking this approach
              requires legal support and significant financial resources. It is
              therefore not an ideal route for small organizations, but may be
              an option for better-resourced organizations such as affordable
              housing developers.

              A private land use agreement can be a fast and easy way to get

          What do you mean by "do nothing"?
        </h2>
        <p className="body-md">
          Although most properties have at least one reasonable way to get
          access to them, in some cases, a property may have a particular
          combination of factors that make it difficult to impossible to get
          access to. For example, it may be a valuable property owned by a
          company that is planning to develop the property at a later date. If
          the company is unwilling to sell the property or negotiate a private
          land use agreement, there is basically no way to legally get access to
          the property. In these cases, we suggest that a more productive use of
          your time would be to focus on other properties where you can more
          easily pursue an intervention.

          The four options mentioned above are not a complete list of ways to
          get access to a vacant property in Philadelphia. There are several

          depend completely on your individual circumstances. Since Clean &

          you specifically qualify for these programs. However, if you think you

              A tangled title is a situation in which the deed to a property
              lists the name of someone other than the apparent owner. This
              often happens when children or grandchildren live in homes that
              are still listed in the name of a deceased parent or grandparent,
              for example. Tangled titles are a major issue in Philadelphia,
              affecting at least 10,000 properties

              This can be a good way to get full legal ownership of a property

              very complicated process. It usually requires a lawyer and can
              require taking on years of unpaid property taxes. If you believe
