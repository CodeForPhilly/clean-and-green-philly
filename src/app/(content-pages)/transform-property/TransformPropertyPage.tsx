        “cleaning and greening.” This includes removing trash, grading the land,
        planting trees, installing low fences, and maintaining the property.
        These are low-cost interventions and have been proven to be highly
        effective; even something as simple as picking up trash can have a big

        Different properties have different opportunities and different
        challenges. Some properties might be a great spot for a rain garden but
        not for a playground. Likewise, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to start a
        community garden in a vacant lot that doesn&rsquo;t get any sun. To

        Additional Considerations
      </h2>

      <div className="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-8 mt-8 outline outline-1 outline-transparent">
        <h3 className="heading-xl font-bold mb-4">Funding</h3>
        <p className="body-md mb-4">
          Getting funding is a vital part of returning vacant properties to
          productive use. Funding can come from many sources, such as grants
          from local government and non-profit funders, public-private partners,
          and crowd-sourced fundraising. In the future, we plan to add a page to
          list common funding sources and explain how to use data from Clean
          &amp; Green Philly to support a grant application.
        </p>
        <p className="body-md mb-4">
          Any amount of funding can be useful. Many effective interventions such
          as property cleanups can be accomplished for a few hundred dollars—or
          even for free, with volunteer support! When planning your property
          intervention, consider what level of funding you have access to, and
          how you can get the most bang for your buck.
        </p>
        <p className="body-md mb-4">
          Funding is needed not only for the initial property transformation,
          but also to maintain the project in the long term. When planning your
          project, consider dividing your funding into two parts: one part to
          pay for the initial intervention, and a second part—at least equal to
          the first part—to pay for maintaining your project in the future.

      <div className="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-8 mt-8 outline outline-1 outline-transparent">
        <h3 className="heading-xl font-bold mb-4">Maintenance</h3>
        <p className="body-md mb-4">
          Transforming a vacant property isn&rsquo;t a one-and-done event. In
          fact, many properties that are currently vacant were transformed years
          ago—but not maintained in the decades since. In order to make sure
          that your intervention is high-impact and long-lived, make sure to
          have a maintenance plan in place.
        </p>
        <p className="body-md mb-4">
          Consider who will be responsible for maintaining the property, what
          their tasks will be, what kind of resources they will need, and how
          you will fund this ongoing maintenance. Often, partnering with an
          established organization like a CDC can help make sure that you have
          the capacity and resources needed to ensure that your intervention
          continues to be effective for many years into the future.
