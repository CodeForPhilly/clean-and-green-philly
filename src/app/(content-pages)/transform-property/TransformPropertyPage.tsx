          Clean & Green Philly aims to help reduce gun violence by intervening
          in vacant properties. Very simply, this means improving the property.
          This can range from removing trash to planting a community garden,
          from trimming trees to building affordable housing. Below, we lay out
          ways to transform a vacant property into something that positively
          impacts the neighborhood around it.

          Types of Interventions
        </h2>
        <p className="body-md ml-4">
          The original research that Clean & Green Philly is based on promotes
          “cleaning and greening”. This includes removing trash, grading the
          land, planting trees, installing low fences, and maintaining the
          property. These are low-cost interventions and have been proven to be
          highly effective; even something as simple as cleaning up trash can
          have a big impact. That said, there are many ways to transform a
          vacant property. You could, for example:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 my-4 ml-4">
          <li>Partner with a local restaurant to offer outdoor eating</li>
          <li>Install bike parking</li>
          <li>
            Work with the Philadelphia Water Department to install green
            stormwater infrastructure
          </li>
          <li>
            Plant a pollinator garden to attract birds, butterflies, and bees
          </li>
          <li>
            Connect with a non-profit organization to build affordable housing
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="body-md ml-4">
          These are just some of the many possibilities. Remember to be both
          creative and practical: there is no one-size-fits-all solution, and
          Philadelphia will need a variety of uses in its vacant properties,
          including green space, housing, parks, commercial space, and more.

          Different properties have different opportunities and different
          challenges. Some properties might be a great spot for a rain garden
          but not for a playground. Likewise, you wouldn’t want to start a
          community garden in a vacant lot that doesn’t get any sun. To better
          understand what your options are for a specific property, try filling

          maintenance you’re willing or able to do.

          Many organizations in Philadelphia offer support transforming vacant
          properties.

          Community Groups and Local Representatives

        <p className="body-md ml-4">
          For help with greening projects, reach out to local Neighborhood
          Advisory Committees, Community Development Corporations, or Registered
          Community Organizations. They can guide you through the planning
          process and help with local rules. Local representatives can also
          support you, especially if you're facing red tape. Bring them a solid
          plan and show how your project can improve the community.

                It's also key to make sure that the improvements you make can

                Remember, your projects shouldn't push out the current

                other local groups, schools, and businesses - it's a great way
                to get more resources and ideas. Have regular meetings with
                people in the community to keep them in the loop and involved in
                decisions.
