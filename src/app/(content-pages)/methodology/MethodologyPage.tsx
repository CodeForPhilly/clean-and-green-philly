          Clean & Green Philly combines several public datasets in order to
          categorize Philadelphia’s vacant properties based on how important it
          is that someone intervene there and what the easiest way to do that
          is. To do this, we created a dataset based on{" "}

            Getting legal access to intervene in a property is a significant
            obstacle to cleaning and greening vacant properties. We hope to
            reduce this barrier by helping users identify the most properties
            with the simplest or most attainable routes of getting access. We
            identify these routes by considering various factors.

            Gun Crime Calculations
          </h2>
          <p className="body-md mb-4">
            It is impossible to reduce the impact of a shooting to a single
            statistic, and Clean & Green Philly applauds the organizations
            throughout our city who work to give voice to the profound effect of
            this epidemic on individuals, families, and communities. With this
            in mind, we have done our best to estimate the spatial intensity of
            gun violence in Philadelphia in a way that is 1) statistically
            rigorous and 2) as sensitive to local experience as possible.
            Following Dr. South&rsquo;s original research, we use a kernel
            density estimate to calculate the intensity of gun crime at any
            given point in Philadelphia. Specifically, we use an adaptive
            bandwidth to better capture the local nuances of gun crime at small
            spatial scales. (For more on this, please see this memo from the
