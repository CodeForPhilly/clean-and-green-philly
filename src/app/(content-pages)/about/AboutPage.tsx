                    With homicides trending up since 2013, and a record high of
                    562 gun deaths in 2021, community members need concrete
                    solutions. Many solutions focus on long-term impact,
                    including nearly 80% of the City of Philadelphia&rsquo;s
                    anti-violence spending. But immediate, actionable approaches
                    are also needed.

                    Research shows that greening and cleaning vacant properties
                    is one of the most impactful, cost-effective interventions
                    available to reduce gun violence in a neighborhood. For
                    example, Dr. Eugenia South and her team have demonstrated
                    that greening vacant lots in Philadelphia reduced gun
                    violence by as much as 29% in the surrounding area.

                    Transforming Philadelphia&rsquo;s vacant lots should be a
                    key strategy to combating gun violence here. But in a city
                    with nearly 40,000 vacant properties, the main obstacle is
                    figuring out which properties to prioritize and how to get
                    access to them.

                    how to transform the properties they’ve identified, and
                    connect users to resources that can support them.
