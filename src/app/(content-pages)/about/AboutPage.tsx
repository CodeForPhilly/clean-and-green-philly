                With homicides trending up since 2013, and a record high of 562
                gun deaths in 2021, community members need concrete solutions.
                Many solutions focus on long-term impact, including nearly 80%
                of the City of Philadelphia&rsquo;s anti-violence spending. But
                immediate, actionable approaches are also needed.

                Research shows that greening and cleaning vacant properties is
                one of the most impactful, cost-effective interventions
                available to reduce gun violence in a neighborhood. For example,
                Dr. Eugenia South and her team have demonstrated that greening
                vacant lots in Philadelphia reduced gun violence by as much as
                29% in the surrounding area.

                Transforming Philadelphia&rsquo;s vacant lots should be a key
                strategy to combating gun violence here. But in a city with
                nearly 40,000 vacant properties, the main obstacle is figuring
                out which properties to prioritize and how to get access to
                them.

                Our vision was to empower local residents, non-profit
                organizations, and government stakeholders to find and
                prioritize vacant properties for interventions, understand how
                to transform the properties theyâ€™ve identified, and connect
                users to resources that can support them.

                We created a dataset based on the original research conducted by
                Dr. Eugenia South and her colleagues, as well as many
                conversations with stakeholders, including community residents,
                CDCs, City government offices, academic researchers, and more.
                We analyzed and combined many data sets on crime, green space,
                and properties.
