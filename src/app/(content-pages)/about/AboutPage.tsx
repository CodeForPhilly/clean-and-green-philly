                With homicides trending up since 2013, and a record high of 562
                gun deaths in 2021, community members need concrete solutions.
                Many solutions focus on long-term impact, including nearly 80%
                of the City of Philadelphia&rsquo;s anti-violence spending. But
                immediate, actionable approaches are also needed.

                Research shows that greening and cleaning vacant properties is
                one of the most impactful, cost-effective interventions
                available to reduce gun violence in a neighborhood. For example,
                Dr. Eugenia South and her team have demonstrated that greening
                vacant lots in Philadelphia reduced gun violence by as much as
                29% in the surrounding area.

                Transforming Philadelphia&rsquo;s vacant lots should be a key
                strategy to combating gun violence here. But in a city with
                nearly 40,000 vacant properties, the main obstacle is figuring
                out which properties to prioritize and how to get access to
                them.

                to transform the properties theyâ€™ve identified, and connect

              improving Philadelphia neighborhoods. You can use it to find
              current information on vacant properties, identify which
              properties need attention most urgently, learn about interventions
              like cleaning or greening, and connect to resources and community

            <p className="body-md mb-3">
              Priority levels are determined by gun crime density, L&I code
              violations, L&I complaints density, tree canopy coverage, and
              whether the property is already maintained by PHS LandCare:

                and either have code violations, high complaint density, or are
                not in PHS LandCare. Also includes properties with medium gun
                crime rates that have violations/complaints but aren&rsquo;t in
                PHS LandCare and have very low tree canopy (less than 70%

                above average that have violations/complaints and are in PHS
                LandCare, or have violations/complaints but aren&rsquo;t in PHS
                LandCare and have adequate tree canopy. Also includes properties

                don&rsquo;t have violations/complaints and have adequate tree
                canopy.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Low Priority (green)</strong>: Properties in areas with
                gun crime rates at or below average, or properties with medium
                gun crime rates that have no violations/complaints.

            </h3>
            <p className="body-md">
              No, your neighborhood absolutely matters. We use a very narrow
              definition of &lsquo;high priority&rsquo; - only about 10% of
              vacant properties get this label. This doesn&rsquo;t mean the
              other 90% don&rsquo;t have real problems. We&rsquo;re trying to
              help people focus limited time and resources on the places where
              intervention might have the biggest impact first. A &lsquo;Low
              Priority&rsquo; rating isn&rsquo;t a judgment about your
              neighborhood - it&rsquo;s about helping everyone be strategic with
              where to start.

              We focus on vacant land and properties suitable for cleaning,

              used for community gardens, vacant commercial storefronts,
              industrial sites, occupied but underused buildings, short-term
              vacancies, vacant units inside occupied apartment buildings, or
              land not suitable for greening due to legal or environmental
              barriers.
