      <h2 className="heading-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Conformance Status</h2>
      <p>
        The Clean & Green Philly website has been evaluated using the Web
        Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 for Level AA conformance.
        While we strive for full accessibility, the site is currently partially
        conformant with WCAG 2.2 Level AA, meaning some aspects of the content
        do not yet fully meet these standards.

        Limitations & Alternatives
      </h2>
      <p>
        While Clean and Green Philly constantly aims to ensure accessibility of
        our web pages, there are currently some limitations:
      </p>
      <ol className="list-decimal ml-8 my-2">
        <li>
          <span className="font-bold">Find Property Filters</span>: While it is
          usable, the overall screen reader experience of selecting, deselecting
          and clearing of filter options isn’t optimized. We currently have open
          issues to resolve this.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-bold">Announcing change of state</span>: Find
          Property filters and pagination may not always announce the change,
          such as if a new content has loaded, or when an option has been
          removed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-bold">Interactive Map</span>: Despite our best
          efforts, some elements in our interactive maps, particularly the
          properties, may not be fully accessible. Although we selected the most
          accessible map library available, some criteria couldn’t be met
          without compromising the essential purpose and meaning of what we
          represent in the map. We are actively researching ways to enhance its
          accessibility. In the meantime, we recommend using the property list
          as an alternative.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This project is an open-source initiative run by dedicated volunteers.
        While we strive to address issues as quickly and thoroughly as possible,
        our capacity is limited. We are committed to doing our best and greatly
        appreciate your patience and understanding as we work within these
        constraints.
