        Clean & Green Philly can help you prioritize vacant properties to return
        to productive use. We encourage cleaning and greening interventions, but
        also recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. To address
        gun violence and vacancy in Philadelphia, we will need a range of
        interventions, each tailored to local context. Below, we lay out ways
        that you can use this site to identify a property, understand how to get
        legal access to it, and think about the ways in which you might best
        return it to productive useâ€”whether through cleaning and greening or
        otherwise.
      </p>

      <h2 className="heading-2xl font-bold mt-8">What can I do?</h2>
      <p className="body-md">
        Using this site, you can identify a high impact property, figure out how
        to get legal access to it, and decide on your preferred intervention to
        return the lot to productive use.
      </p>

      <p className="body-md">
        At a minimum, we encourage cleaning and greening. This involves:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Removing trash and debris</li>
        <li>Grading the land</li>
        <li>Planting trees</li>
        <li>Installing low fences</li>
        <li>Regular maintenance</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="body-md">
        The cost for these kinds of projects is usually low, about $5 per square
        yard, with maintenance around $0.50 per square yard. Even if you
        can&rsquo;t do everything, small steps like putting up a fence, planting
        some trees, or just keeping the area clean can make a big difference.

        How can Clean & Green Philly help me take action?
      </h2>

      <p className="body-md">Basic use of Clean & Green Philly is simple:</p>
      <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>
          Use the map to identify properties where you can have the highest
          impact for the most manageable effort.
        </li>
        <li>
          Based on the information provided in the tool about the property,
          identify how you can get access to it and what type of
          transformation(s) might be appropriate there.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use that information to get support from funders, local politicians,
          and others, to help you carry out your chosen intervention.
        </li>
        <li>Take action!</li>
      </ol>

      <p className="body-md">
        In the future, we hope to add more specific information on things like
        applying for small grants, navigating the legal system, and more.
