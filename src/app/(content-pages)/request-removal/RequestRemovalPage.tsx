        . Submit a detailed request for removal, including the specific address
        of the property and a thorough explanation of your reasons for
        requesting its removal. Documentation such as photos of the site in use
        are encouraged. We will review the reason for your request and respond
        as quickly as we can. In making our decision, we will consider whether
        we believe the request is reasonable and consistent with positive
        community impact and anti-gun violence initiatives.

        Our team reserves the right to make the final decision on whether a
        property will be removed from the dashboard. Please note that requests
        to remove properties solely for personal gain, such as protecting
        private parking spaces or assisting negligent property owners, will not
        be entertained. By submitting a request, you acknowledge and agree that
        the final decision rests with our team, and not all requests may result
        in the removal of a property listing.
