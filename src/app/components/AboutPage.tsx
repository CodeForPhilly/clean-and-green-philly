            Clean & Green Philly was built to respond to Philadelphia’s historic
            gun violence problem. With homicides trending up since 2013, and a
            record high of 562 gun deaths in 2021, community members need
            concrete solutions.

            Green Philly helps to fill that gap by promoting interventions in
            vacant properties. Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for
            everyday Philadelphians to take action to reduce gun violence in our
            city.

            Research shows that greening and cleaning vacant properties is one
            of the most impactful, cost-effective interventions available to
            reduce gun violence in a neighborhood. For example, Dr. Eugenia
            South and her team have demonstrated that

            Transforming Philadelphia’s vacant lots should be a key strategy to
            combating gun violence here. But in a city with nearly 40,000 vacant
            properties, the main obstacle is figuring out which properties to
            prioritize and how to get access to them. Clean & Green Philly helps
            solve this problem by using public data to identify high-priority
            properties, filter them based on the possible ways of intervening,
            and connect users to resources that can support these interventions.

            Clean & Green Philly combines several public datasets in order to
            categorize Philadelphia’s vacant properties based on how important
            it is that someone intervene there and what the easiest way to do
            that is.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            We created the dataset based on the original research conducted by
            Dr. Eugenia South and her colleagues, as well as many conversations
            with stakeholders, including community residents, CDCs, City
            government offices, academic researchers, and more.
