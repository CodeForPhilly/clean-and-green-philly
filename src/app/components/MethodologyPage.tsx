            Clean & Green Philly combines several public datasets in order to
            categorize Philadelphia’s vacant properties based on how important
            it is that someone intervene there and what the easiest way to do
            that is. To do this, we created a dataset based on{" "}

            How did you determine "possible impact"?

          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            Clean & Green Philly aims to reduce gun violence by cleaning and
            greening vacant properties. Accordingly, we base our calculation of
            possible impact on which properties 1) have high levels of gun
            violence and 2) are not clean and/or green. Additionally, we
            consider whether the property in question is already accounted for
            in{" "}

            Concretely, we combine Philadelphia Police Department data on gun

            How did you determine "access process"?
          </h2>

          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            Getting legal access to intervene in a property is a significant
            obstacle to cleaning and greening vacant properties. We hope to
            reduce this barrier by helping users identify the most properties
            with the simplest or most attainable routes of getting access. We
            identify these routes by considering various factors, such as the
            owner of the property (e.g., a private individual versus the
            Philadelphia Land Bank), the price of the property, and whether it
            may qualify for Act 135 conservatorship. We based our criteria on
            local law and land disposition policies, as well as the availability
            and applicability of data. Some of our guiding references include{" "}

            Gun Crime Calculations
          </h2>

          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            It is impossible to reduce the impact of a shooting to a single
            statistic, and Clean & Green Philly applauds the organizations
            throughout our city who work to give voice to the profound effect of
            this epidemic on individuals, families, and communities. With this
            in mind, we have done our best to estimate the spatial intensity of
            gun violence in Philadelphia in a way that is 1) statistically
            rigorous and 2) as sensitive to local experience as possible.
            Following Dr. South’s original research, we use a kernel density
            estimate to calculate the intensity of gun crime at any given point
            in Philadelphia. Specifically, we use an adaptive bandwidth to
            better capture the local nuances of gun crime at small spatial
            scales. (For more on this, please see this memo from the data
            analysis team at the District Attorney’s Office [link].)
