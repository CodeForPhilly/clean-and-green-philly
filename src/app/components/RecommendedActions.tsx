        This approach has been shown to be inexpensive and cost-effective, with costs averaging about $5 per square meter and maintenance averaging $0.50 per square meter thereafter.

      <p className="mb-4">
        To carry out something like this, try getting in touch with your local Neighborhood Advisory Committee, a nearby Community Development Corporation, or your local representative. Explain to them what you want to do and why. Show them this map to support your explanation!

        Be mindful of trespassing on private property. You can use the dashboard tool above to identify which lots are privately owned. Consider reaching out to a lot owner and explaining why you want to carry out a lot cleanup in order to get permission.

        Lastly, you can also use these data to convince your NAC, CDC, elected official, or another organization to take action. If you are interested in getting specific data that were used to build this tool, contact me and let me know how I can help.
