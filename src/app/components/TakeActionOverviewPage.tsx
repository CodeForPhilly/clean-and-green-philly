        <p>
          Clean & Green Philly can help you prioritize vacant properties to return to productive use. We encourage cleaning and greening interventions, but also recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. To address gun violence and vacancy in Philadelphia, we will need a range of interventions, each tailored to local context. Below, we lay out ways that you can use this site to identify a property, understand how to get legal access to it, and think about the ways in which you might best return it to productive use—whether through cleaning and greening or otherwise.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">What can I do?</h2>
        <p>
          Using this site, you can identify a high impact property, figure out how to get legal access to it, and decide on your preferred intervention to return the lot to productive use. 
        </p>

        <p>At a minimum, we encourage cleaning and greening. This involves:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Removing trash and debris</li>
          <li>Grading the land</li>
          <li>Planting trees</li>
          <li>Installing low fences</li>
          <li>Regular maintenance</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The cost for these kinds of projects is usually low, about $5 per square yard, with maintenance around $0.50 per square yard. Even if you can't do everything, small steps like putting up a fence, planting some trees, or just keeping the area clean can make a big difference.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">How can Clean & Green Philly help me take action?</h2>

        <p>Basic use of Clean & Green Philly is simple:</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Use the map to identify properties where you can have the highest impact for the most manageable effort.</li>
          <li>Based on the information provided in the tool about the property, identify how you can get access to it and what type of transformation(s) might be appropriate there.</li>
          <li>Use that information to get support from funders, local politicians, and others, to help you carry out your chosen intervention.</li>
          <li>Take action!</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          In the future, we hope to add more specific information on things like applying for small grants, navigating the legal system, and more.
